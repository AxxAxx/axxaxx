# Hi, I'm Axel Johansson! 

üõ†Ô∏è I am a mechatronics engineer by profession and a maker by heart  


### Skills I enjoy to deploy
- :electric_plug: Electrical design of single PCBs to larger systems and mechatronic integration.  
- :computer: Solid mechanics simulations (FEM) in ABAQUS, HyperMesh, OPTISTRUCT.  
- :chart_with_upwards_trend: Structural optimization, parameter optimization, top-opt, sizing- and shape optimization.  
- :battery: Battery topology and BMS design.  
- :mag_right: Reverse engineering and disassembly analysis of electrical/mechanical devices.  
- :straight_ruler: Data acquisition and data analysis of physical systems using National instruments, Python, and self-developed sensors.  
- :nut_and_bolt: Mechanical design of robotics, mechanical structures and systems.
- :microscope: CNC machining (CAM, CAD) and high tolerance machining strategies. 
  
    
### Things I keep myself busy with
- :boom: Buying a great product just to realize I can do it better and develop my own version. [AxxSolder](https://github.com/AxxAxx/AxxSolder) for example.
- :bike: Driving hard enduro motorcycle in the forest. This is why [AxxBeam](https://github.com/AxxAxx/AxxBeam) was developed. :flashlight: :last_quarter_moon:
- üí™ Sport climbing is my weekly training routine.
- üå± Learning about ML and Reinforcement learning in optimal control.
